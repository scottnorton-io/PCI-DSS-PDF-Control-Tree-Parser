# AI Assistant Usage for PCI DSS PDF Control Tree Parser

This project may use AI-assisted tooling to help draft code, documentation,
and supporting materials.

## Principles

- AI tools are **advisory only** and do not make compliance determinations.
- All AI-generated outputs are treated as **drafts** and must be reviewed
  and validated by a qualified PCI DSS assessor or engineer.
- No live cardholder data (CHD) or sensitive authentication data (SAD) is
  to be shared with or processed by AI tools.

## Required Metadata

For any artifacts influenced by AI assistance, include metadata such as:

```plaintext
status: "Draft – AI Generated"
reviewer: "TBD"
validation_date: "TBD"
source_reference: "<short identifier>"
```

This metadata helps maintain an auditable trail for downstream PCI DSS assessments.
